# azure-http-trigger

In this project I have used Azure functions to trigger a file upload into a blob container in Azure Storage explorer

A file upload into one blob container will trigger a function(pythin function here) which will do processing according to our usecase and upload the processed file to another blob container in Azure Storage Explorer.

I have used VS code editor with extensions Azure Account and Azure Functions.

For more details refer to the **Working with Azure Blob trigger.pdf** file.
